STATEMENT OF FACTS

Your affiant, [Your Name], is a [Your Title] with [Your Organization] and is currently involved in the investigation of criminal activity related to the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. As part of my duties, I have been authorized by law or by a relevant government agency to engage in the prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution of offenses.

On January 6, 2021, at approximately 1330 hours, a large crowd had assembled outside the U.S. Capitol. Despite security measures, including permanent and temporary barriers manned by U.S. Capitol Police, several individuals forced entry into the U.S. Capitol at approximately 1400 hours. During my investigation, I identified two suspects, Kevin Seefried and Hunter Seefried, who had entered the Senate Building through a broken window around 1413 hours. Video footage obtained from the U.S. Capitol showed Defendant Kevin Seefried holding a Confederate Battle flag inside the Capitol Building, while Hunter Seefried was seen taking a selfie photograph or video at approximately 1429 hours. They both were part of a larger group that verbally confronted U.S. Capitol police officers for about 15 minutes. The Seefrieds left the Capitol at around 1436 hours from the Senate Carriage Door.

Further investigation revealed that the suspects were identified following a report from Hunter Seefried's coworker, who reported Hunter Seefried had bragged about being in the Capitol with his father on January 6, 2021. Subsequent review of Kevin Seefried's driver’s license photo matched the image of the individual seen holding the Confederate Battle Flag. The relationship between Kevin Seefried and Hunter Seefried was confirmed.

On January 12, 2021, both Kevin Seefried and Hunter Seefried participated in voluntary interviews with the FBI. During these interviews, both defendants confirmed their participation in the events at the Capitol as described above. Kevin Seefried admitted he had brought the Confederate Battle flag seen in the video footage from his home in Delaware.

Lastly, Twitter video footage reviewed showed Hunter Seefried punching out glass in a window in the Capitol complex after it was initially broken by a wooden 2 x 4 by people in the crowd. Kevin Seefried confirmed that an unknown individual asked his son to assist in clearing the window because he was wearing gloves. Following this, the crowd, including the Seefrieds, was able to gain access to the interior of the Capitol Building.

Based on the above findings, there is probable cause to believe that Kevin Seefried and Hunter Seefried violated 18 U.S.C. § 1752(a)(1) and (2), which makes it a crime to knowingly enter or remain in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and with intent to impede or disrupt the orderly conduct of Government business or official functions. Therefore, I respectfully request the issuance of an arrest warrant for the defendant(s) to ensure their appearance in court and facilitate the administration of justice.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.
