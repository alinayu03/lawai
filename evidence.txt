REPORT
Date: June 26, 2023 Title: Unlawful Entry and Disorderly Conduct at U.S. Capitol Narrative Report: By Special Agent [Your Name] Officer Name: [Your Name]
INTRODUCTION
On January 6, 2021, at approximately 1330 hours, I was assigned to investigate criminal activity at the U.S. Capitol grounds, located at First Street, SE, in Washington, D.C. The nature of the incident involved the illegal intrusion of a large crowd into the Capitol building, disrupting the certification of the 2020 Presidential Election by the United States Congress. Additional officers, including U.S. Capitol Police, were present at the scene.
BODY
Upon my arrival, I observed that a large crowd had assembled outside the U.S. Capitol. Despite security measures, including permanent and temporary barriers manned by U.S. Capitol Police, several individuals forced entry into the U.S. Capitol at approximately 1400 hours.
During my investigation, I identified two suspects, Kevin Seefried and Hunter Seefried, who had entered the Senate Building through a broken window around 1413 hours. Video footage obtained from the U.S. Capitol showed Defendant Kevin Seefried holding a Confederate Battle flag inside the Capitol Building, while Hunter Seefried was seen taking a selfie photograph or video at approximately 1429 hours. They both were part of a larger group that verbally confronted U.S. Capitol police officers for about 15 minutes. The Seefrieds left the Capitol at around 1436 hours from the Senate Carriage Door.
Further investigation revealed that the suspects were identified following a report from Hunter Seefried's coworker, who reported Hunter Seefried had bragged about being in the Capitol with his father on January 6, 2021. Subsequent review of Kevin Seefried's driver’s license photo matched the image of the individual seen holding the Confederate Battle Flag. The relationship between Kevin Seefried and Hunter Seefried was confirmed.
On January 12, 2021, both Kevin Seefried and Hunter Seefried participated in voluntary interviews with the FBI. During these interviews, both defendants confirmed their participation in the events at the Capitol as described above. Kevin Seefried admitted he
had brought the Confederate Battle flag seen in the video footage from his home in Delaware.
Lastly, Twitter video footage reviewed showed Hunter Seefried punching out glass in a window in the Capitol complex after it was initially broken by a wooden 2 x 4 by people in the crowd. Kevin Seefried confirmed that an unknown individual asked his son to assist in clearing the window because he was wearing gloves. Following this, the crowd, including the Seefrieds, was able to gain access to the interior of the Capitol Building.
CONCLUSION
Based on the above findings, there is probable cause to believe that Kevin Seefried and Hunter Seefried violated 18 U.S.C. § 1752(a)(1) and (2), which makes it a crime to knowingly enter or remain in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and with intent to impede or disrupt the orderly conduct of Government business or official functions. My next course of action is to apply for a warrant for the arrest of Kevin Seefried and Hunter Seefried. There is nothing further to report.
Signed, [Your Name] Special Agent, FBI
